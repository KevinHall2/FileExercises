File Exercies
This program creates .txt files based on given information in the programming, takes those lines of text in the files and assigns that information to variables.
The variables' values are then printed in the console.

For this to work, you must create a new folder and name it "contacts" in the same folder as the .exe file. The .txt files will show up in the "contacts" folder after the program is ran.
